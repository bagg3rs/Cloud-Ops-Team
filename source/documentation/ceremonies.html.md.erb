# Our Ceremonies

The cloud ops team has the following regular ceremonies.

## Stand up 

Our stand ups run daily at 09:30 and last for 15 minutes.  We will follow one of two formats : 
- "Walk the board" : Starting with the "Done" column we discuss any active tickets in Jira.
- "Yesterday, today, blockers" : A round robin of each team member discussing their tickets and any blockers.

## Sprint planning 

Our team runs on 2 week sprints that start on a Wednesday.  
We use [Metro Retro](https://metroretro.io/) to run these sessions (usually 1hr). Template agenda below:

1. Discuss the previous sprint and if we met our goal, did we achieve anything outside of our goal? (10m)
1. Discuss tickets in the backlog and add sticky notes for a potential sprint goal and any risks concerns (10m)
1. Reveal all stickies and vote for your favourite 5 votes (2m)
1. Discuss the top 3 goals and finalise a sprint goal (15m)
1. Discuss and finalise any concerns (5m)
1. Pull tickets into the sprint
1. Any other business

## Backlog refinement

On Monday mornings we have a 45m session on backlog refinement. This ceremony is for us to agree as a team that any ticket created has enough information for someone to pick up.  Once a ticket is refined we also estimate it using the [Fibonacci scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_scale_(agile)).

## Backlog grooming

A weekly 30m ceremony for ensuring the top of the backlog is prioritised.  It also stimulates discussion about potenital new tickets that should be created before refinement the following week.

## Sprint retrospective

At the end of each sprint we have a 1hr retrospective.  This is for the team to openly discuss positives and negatives of the sprint.  The format is regularly changed to keep the retro fresh and effective.  For this we use [Parabol](https://parabol.co)
