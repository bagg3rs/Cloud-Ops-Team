Welcome to the team! Below is some information that you might find useful.

## General information

- We have our sprint ceremonies every fortnight on a Tuesday afternoon.
- We plan our sprints through [Jira](https://dsdmoj.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=432&projectKey=PTTP&selectedIssue=PTTP-2970&quickFilter=1066).

### Team

Please see our [team information](/#general-information) for:

- Who's in the team
- Our alliance
- Our roadmap
- Our ceremonies

### Your first sprint ceremonies

When you join the team, we want you to feel welcome and included. With your input, we'll collectively update our [team alliance], and you'll be able to meet the team if you haven't done so already.

## Tools

### Communication


We use Microsoft Teams and Google Meet for team calls, and use Slack for direct calls.

Our main chat platform is Slack, and this is our preferred method of communication.

Download Slack from the [Company Portal](companyportal:ApplicationId=5b3a3776-9335-4994-b940-edb324794764) on your MoJ issued laptop. 

We have three main Slack channels listed below.

#### #mojo-cloud-ops

The [#mojo-cloud-ops](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C01J2L0SC0P) channel is our team channel where we have team discussions about anything ranging from:

- in-depth technical issues
- our plans for the day
- to request someone else from the team's help
- when we're away for lunch
- general musings

If you can't make standup, post your standup update here.

#### #ask-cloud-ops

The [#ask-cloud-ops](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C026AFE617T) channel is for anyone who isn't in the team to:

- ask questions about the services we run
- get advice from the team

#### #mojo-cloud-ops-notifications

The [#mojo-cloud-ops-notifications](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C023F6BDH2S) channel is where we direct notifications from GitHub, such as pull requests or issues.

It's a noisy channel, so it's up to you whether to join it.

#### GitHub teams to join (optional)

To add or close issues in our GitHub Project, you need to join the [MOJ-Official-Techops](https://github.com/orgs/ministryofjustice/teams/moj-official-techops) team on GitHub.

The team memberships are [defined in code](). If you're comfortable doing so, please add your GitHub username there.

If you're not comfortable updating Terraform files, send a message in the [#mojo-cloud-ops](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C01J2L0SC0P) channel and someone in the team will help you.

### Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

Download the Ubuntu subsytem from the [Company Portal](companyportal:ApplicationId=59ecb0a7-0f6b-45fc-8242-1135bc2b538b).

To successfully start the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) here and update the package (if you don't starting Ubuntu will fail)
https://aka.ms/wsl2kernel as detailed [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/wsl/install-win10#step-4---download-the-linux-kernel-update-package)

#### Ubuntu
- In Start search for 'Ubuntu' and start the Ubuntu system.

- This will prompt you to create a User, do so. You will use this username later.

#### Windows Terminal
To access Settings open Windows Terminal and click the V arrow on the Taskbar:

- Change Default Profile to Ubuntu

- In the Ubuntu Profile, edit the Startup Directory to \\wsl$\Ubuntu\home\*your-ubuntu-username*/

- Save your settings

- Restart the app and confirm you can access your Ubuntu subsystem

- (optional) Change your colour scheme. Save your eyes! üëÄ


### VSCode 

The team uses [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on a daily basis. 

Some of our preferred extensions are listed below, to install these extensions on VSCode (_Ctrl + Shift + P; "Install Extensions"_):

- [Remote WSL](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl) (Open any folder in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and take advantage of Visual Studio Code's full feature set, install the requested updates for Ubuntu when prompted)

- [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) (Visualize code authorship at a glance via Git blame annotations and code lens, seamlessly navigate and explore Git repositories, gain valuable insights via powerful comparison commands, and so much more)

- [Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) (Real-time collaborative development from the comfort of your favorite tools.)

- [HashiCorp Terraform](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HashiCorp.terraform) (Syntax highlighting and autocompletion for Terraform)

- [Gitmoji](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vtrois.gitmoji-vscode) üòé (An emoji tool for your git commit messages)

- [Ruby](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bung87.rails) (Ruby on Rails support for Visual Studio Code)

- [Tabnine](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TabNine.tabnine-vscode) (üë©‚Äçüíªü§ñ JavaScript, Python, Java, Typescript & all other languages - AI Code completion plugin. Tabnine makes developers more productive by auto-completing their code.)

- (optional) Change your colour scheme. Save your eyes! üëÄ 
[Dracula](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dracula-theme.theme-dracula) üßõ is a good one. 

If you've installed any Extensions prior to installing Remote WSL, re-install them on the WSL Ubuntu. To do this an 'Install' button should appear on these extensions when viewed on the Extensions (under WSL:
Ubuntu) submenu on the left hand side of VS Code.


### Learning and development

## Further information

We're currently building our documentation to cover core concepts and general practices within the team.

It's worth having a read through the user guide and concepts pages.

There is a varying level of technical detail across the documentation, so if you have any questions or are interested in something in particular, feel free to reach out in [#cloud-ops](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C01J2L0SC0P).
